I have built a useful and interactive word counter React application!
Functionality:
* Counts the number of words in a text area.
* Allows users to convert text to uppercase or lowercase.
* Provides a clear screen button to reset the text area.
Technical aspects:
* Utilizes React's useState hook for state management.
* Leverages event handlers to capture user input and button clicks.
* Implements logic to split text by spaces for word counting.
* Includes functionality to convert text to uppercase or lowercase based on user interaction.

   Curious to see it in action? Feel free to check out my LinkedIn profile for a demonstration!
